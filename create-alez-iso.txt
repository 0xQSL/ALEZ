Creating an updated ALEZ install ISO

Sometimes ALEZ will fail to install because the archlinux-keyring package included 
on the ISO is outdated causing PGP verification of the Arch ZFS repo to fail. If 
that is the case, you may need to create an updated ISO complete with the ZFS packages, 
git and the ALEZ downloader. 

Here are the steps to manually create an updated ALEZ install ISO:

* Boot into an up-to-date install of Arch (but not under LXD/LXC as the build script 
doesn't work in a container) and run the following to install the Arch ISO build 
scripts and their dependencies (and git):

# pacman -S archiso git

* Now copy the releng profile directory:

# cp -r /usr/share/archiso/configs/releng ~/aleziso

* Edit ~/aleziso/packages.x86_64 and add the following lines:

git
archzfs-linux

* Edit ~/aleziso/pacman.conf and add the following lines:

[archzfs]
Server = http://archzfs.com/$repo/x86_64

* Import and sign the archzfs repo key:

# pacman-key -r F75D9D76 && pacman-key --lsign-key F75D9D76

(NB You may want to check the key hasn't changed first by checking 
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial_user_repositories#archzfs )

* Clone the ALEZ repo

git clone https://github.com/danboid/ALEZ.git

* Make airootfs directory for alez downloader:

# mkdir -p ~/aleziso/airootfs/usr/local/bin

* Copy scripts into airootfs tree:

# cd ~/ALEZ/
# cp alez-downloader.sh ~/aleziso/airootfs/usr/local/bin/alez
# cp motd ~/aleziso/airootfs/etc/

* Make alez downloader executable:

# chmod +x ~/aleziso/airootfs/usr/local/bin/alez

* Build the ISO:

# cd ~/aleziso
# ./build.sh -v

When the build process is complete, your ISO will be under ~/aleziso/out
